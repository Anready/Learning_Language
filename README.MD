**Learn Language Application README.md**

The Learn Language application is designed to assist you in learning new words, especially if you spend a significant amount of time using your laptop or computer. Wondering how it works? Every 15 minutes, the application will pop up and take over your entire screen, preventing you from bypassing the word translation challenge. To enhance security, features have been implemented to prevent clicking the Windows button. Furthermore, when closing the application, you'll need to input your password (default: Anready939(T)).

**Who is this application for?**
The Learn Language application is suitable for both adults and children. In the case of children, they won't be able to close the application without knowing the password or without correctly translating the displayed word (as specified in the second part of the program - AddWords).

**How to dismiss the application window?**
Simply enter the correct translation of the word (as specified in the second part of the program - AddWords), and the window will disappear for 15 minutes.

**How to add new words?**
To add new words, access the second executable file. You'll find two fields: the first one for the word or phrase in your native language, and the second one for the translation of the same word or phrase into the language you are learning.
